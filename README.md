# Suspicious IP Address Detection
There are many people that try to get around certain access retrictions using a proxy or VPN. This can be a good thing, and also a good thing. This project tries to figure out if we can detect if someone is using a proxy or not. This will allow you to see the risk factor of an IP Address being at high risk or low risk of being an anonymous proxy, allowing users to put certain temporary bans on high risk proxies.

## Data
The data that was collected is a large file which was not able to be brought onto github. Links to the datasets used will be provided:
- [IP2LOCATION Lite](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/px10-ip-proxytype-country-region-city-isp-domain-usagetype-asn-lastseen-threat-residential) - Able to retrieve csv files or a rar file of IPV4 and IPV6 Addresses

- [Data Hub](https://datahub.io/core/geoip2-ipv4#data-cli) - Able to obtain a csv file of IPV4 Geolocation Addresses which are proxies and non-proxies.
